Inspiration -  
The persona of "Volunteer Victoria" given by Centene puts forth a quote "I love giving back to my community, it makes me feel fulfilled" that connects with all the team members.

What it does -   
It has an app to connect the elderly people with the volunteers using voice and minimal buttons. The volunteers can select the timeslots in which they can allocate their time in community service.

How we built it -   
We used Ionic Framework 5 with firebase for the core functionality. The voice recognition and text to speech is implemented using the Twilio API.
